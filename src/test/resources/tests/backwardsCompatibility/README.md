# Backwards compatibility tests

Contains PNG:s of code generated by older versions. These images should never be recalculated. 
The purpose of the tests is to ensure that a new version can parse games generated by an earlier version.

A new test with most previous and new features should be created for each bytecode
release with all features.

Source for the generated code is in src/ for documentation purposes only.
